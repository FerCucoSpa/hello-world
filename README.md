This is my introduction directory

Hello people!
I'm FerCucoSpa - A 60 year old Spanish Telecommunications Engineer
After a rich carreer as a hw & sw developer, Project Manager, Consultant, Sales, International Purchaser and lastly as a Business Unit Manager, ...
 ... I want to go back to my origin: R&D.
I'm currently re-learning electronics and programming with Arduino, and making my first projects in robotics with C++ and Python.
I love teaching as well, so I see myself doing both things in the next phase of my carreer: developing and teaching.

I'm also a skipper, I love sailing and racing sailboats. I've ran and won many regattas.
